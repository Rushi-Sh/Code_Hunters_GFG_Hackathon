Air Quality Data Analysis and Visualization
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing air quality data to provide users with a clear understanding of air quality levels categorized as "Moderate," "Good," and "Poor." The analysis is conducted at the state level, spanning the years from 2015 to 2020, with the potential for future extensions.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:

Assess and categorize air quality in different states based on key factors, including NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide), NOx (Nitrogen Oxides), CO (Carbon Monoxide), SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide), O3 (Ozone), and AQI (Air Quality Index).

Generate graphical visualizations that effectively communicate air quality trends over time.

Provide valuable insights into the variation and trends in air quality across different regions.

Data Sources
The project utilizes air quality data from reliable sources, ensuring data accuracy and completeness. The data sources may include government agencies, environmental organizations, and research institutions.

Scope
The scope of this project encompasses the following:

Data Collection: Gathering air quality data for NO2, NOx, CO, SO2, O3, and AQI for multiple states in the United States.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring the data for analysis, including handling missing values and outliers.

Data Analysis: Utilizing statistical techniques to analyze the collected data and categorize air quality into "Moderate," "Good," and "Poor."

Graphical Visualization: Creating meaningful and informative visualizations, such as line charts, heatmaps, and state-wise comparisons, to convey air quality trends.

Time Frame: Analyzing data from 2015 to 2020 initially, with the potential to extend the analysis into subsequent years.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Data Collection: Ensure you have access to the air quality data for the desired states and years. Update the data sources and files accordingly.

Environment Setup: Set up a Python environment with the necessary libraries for data analysis and visualization. You can use libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Data Analysis: Implement data analysis scripts to categorize air quality and extract insights. Sample scripts may be provided in the project repository.

Visualization: Create visualizations that effectively convey air quality trends. Sample code for visualization will be available in the project repository.

Documentation: Keep the project documentation up-to-date, including README files, to provide clear instructions and explanations.

Future Extensions
This project is designed to be extendable. Potential future extensions include:

Incorporating data from additional years to identify long-term trends.
Expanding the geographical scope to include more states or countries.
Integrating real-time data for ongoing monitoring and reporting.
